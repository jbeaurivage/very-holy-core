# VERY HOLY CORE

This project is a rewrite of Hugo Babin-Riby's excellent [HOLY CORE course](https://github.com/0BAB1/HOLY_CORE_COURSE) in the [Veryl hardware description language](https://veryl-lang.org/).

While I won't pretend to rewrite the entire course documentation (ie, the course itself), the HDL sources are all rewritten purely in Veryl.

The goal isn't to make a perfect 1:1 reimplementation of HOLY CORE, but rather use it as a starting point, and modify things as a learning experience.

A secondary goal of this project is to make a synthetizable design and run it on an FPGA, hopefully with a completely open-source toolchain (not completed yet). Currently, the single-cycle edition is implemented.
